====================================
===  Changelist for version 1.1
====================================
- Removed accidentally included internal Sun JRE classes (com.sun.*) and replaced with Xerces classes. this
  fixes the NoClassDefFound error you'd encounter on non-sun JREs (like in IBM WebSphere)
- Re-factored code to remove reliance on setUserData() method to allow the code to run in Java 1.4
- Escaped '#' in onsiteURI regular expressions to address a known bug in JVM which interpreted the hash mark as
  a comment character inside of character class definitions []. this flaw allowed disallowed protocol urls (credits 
  to Richard Rodger of Ricebridge Software for discovering this)
- Changed code comment accidentally crediting HTMLCleaner with the cleaning - should be NekoHTML!
- Commented out dead code and gave serializable classes default ids
