====================================
===  Changelist for version 1.1.1
====================================

- Began using (X)HTMLSerializer instead of XMLSerializer to recognize HTML entities
- Fixed code to remove any lingering Java 1.5 dependencies (for real this time)
- Cleaned up AntiSamy() main method to be a little more organized
- Fixed the "dangling quote" scenario discovered by Jeff Williams which could cause XSS if a getCleanHTML() call ended up inside a textbox value attribute
- Added *true* XHTML support with new directive in policy file ("useXHTML")
- Removed any invalid XML characters before processing in order to avoid XML exceptions
- Introduced the ability to specify encoding for input and output
- Made the policy files tolerant of non-latin characters for i18n support
- Removed automatic HTML entity translation support (HTML entities are i18n by default, character codes aren't)

====================================
===  Changelist for version 1.1
====================================
- Removed accidentally included internal Sun JRE classes (com.sun.*) and replaced with Xerces classes. this
  fixes the NoClassDefFound error you'd encounter on non-sun JREs (like in IBM WebSphere)
- Re-factored code to remove reliance on setUserData() method to allow the code to run in Java 1.4
- Escaped '#' in onsiteURI regular expressions to address a known bug in JVM which interpreted the hash mark as
  a comment character inside of character class definitions []. this flaw allowed disallowed protocol urls (credits 
  to Richard Rodger of Ricebridge Software for discovering this)
- Changed code comment accidentally crediting HTMLCleaner with the cleaning - should be NekoHTML!
- Commented out dead code and gave serializable classes default ids
